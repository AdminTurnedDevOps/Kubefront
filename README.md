# PROJECT IN PROGRESS
This project is far from completed, but the first few app routes work, so I figured I'd make it public and see what everyone thinks!

# buildK8s

Buildk8s is an API driven development project that allows you to get Kubernetes resources (pods, deployments, etc.) from a UI

# Why buildk8s?
Build k8s is for fellow Kubernetes/container users that simply want a one-stop place to go without having to run a bunch of commands to see Kubernetes resources

# Examples
http://127.0.0.1:5000/getpods

# Maintainers
